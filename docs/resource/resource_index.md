# Resource data


- [Wind Resource Data](wind_resource:models)
- [Solar Resource Data](solar_resource:models)
- [Tidal Resource Data](tidal_resource:models)

## Common Resource Datasets and Considerations

Both wind and solar resource data can be obtained from resource models that use the [OpenMeteo Archive API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api) or resource models that use the resource models available in the [NLR Developer Network](https://developer.nlr.gov).

Resource models that use the [NLR Developer Network](https://developer.nlr.gov) require an API key (which can be obtained for free from [here](https://developer.nlr.gov/signup/)). Resource models that use the OpenMeteo Archive API do not require an API key.

Another key difference is that the NLR resource datasets are constrained to specific geographic regions, meaning you have to choose the resource model that corresponds to your site location. OpenMeteo resource data is available globally, for all onshore sites.

```{note}
OpenMeteo data can be downloaded directly from the web instead of using the models in H2I. If OpenMeteo resource data is downloaded directly from the web and in the local timezone of the site, the data is downloaded with a UTC offset in *daylight time* whereas data downloaded with the H2I resource models will use a UTC offset in *standard time*. Resource data downloaded from the NLR Developer developer network in local time also use a UTC offset in *standard time*.
```


## Setting resource data for a technology

There are two ways to supply resource data to a technology:
1. Set resource for a technology data [using `set_val()`](#resource-data-specified-using-setval)
2. Create a [custom resource model](#custom-resource-models) for the technology



(resource-data-specified-using-setval)=
### Resource data specified using `set_val()`

Resource data for a technology can be set using the `set_val()` command. In the [Run of River Example](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/tree/develop/examples/07_run_of_river_plant/), the technology named `river` needs a resource input called `discharge`. An example of this is shown below:

```python
import pandas as pd
from h2integrate import H2IntegrateModel
# Create an H2I model
h2i = H2IntegrateModel("07_run_of_river.yaml")

# Suppose we load the resource data from a csv file
resource_df = pd.read_csv("river_resource_data.csv")

# Setup the h2i model
h2i.setup()

# Set the resource data for the river
h2i.set_val("river.discharge", val=resource_df["discharge"].values, units="m**3/s")

# Run the model
h2i.run()
```


(custom-resource-models)=
### Custom resource models
The benefit of using a custom resource model is that the resource data can be made to vary for different inputs, which can be beneficial if running a design sweep or optimization where the resource location (specified by a latitude and longitude) is a design variable.

A general resource model can be defined similarly to a custom technology model. A custom resource model should be defined in the plant configuration file within a site section under `sites`.

```{note}
Note that all custom resource models must have inputs of `latitude` and `longitude`. The outputs of your custom resource model should match the expected input to whatever model its connected to.
```

Below shows an example, similar to the [Run of River Example](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/tree/develop/examples/07_run_of_river_plant/) of how to define a custom resource model within the `plant_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
sites:
  site:
    latitude: 32.34
    longitude: -98.27
    resources:
      river_resource:
        resource_model: CustomRiverResource
        resource_model_location: river_resource/river_resource_model.py
        resource_parameters:
          filename: river_data.csv

resource_to_tech_connections:
  # connect the river resource to the run-of-river hydro technology
  - [site.river_resource, river, discharge]
```

The output `discharge` from the custom `river_resource` model is an input to the technology `river`. The custom resource model is a class named `CustomRiverResource` and the filepath for the `CustomRiverResource` is specified as the `resource_model_location`.
