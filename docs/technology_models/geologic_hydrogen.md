# Geologic Hydrogen Models

Within H2Integrate the geologic hydrogen models are divided into subsurface and surface models.
The hydrogen well subsurface models account for the drilling and completion of any wells, and the working fluids injected to extract or produce hydrogen using this technology.
The hydrogen surface processing models account for the above-surface processing or refinement of the raw hydrogen to commercial grade.

## Hydrogen Well Subsurface Models

There are two performance models available to model the hydrogen well subsurface: one for natural geologic hydrogen and one for stimulated geologic hydrogen.

- [`"NaturalGeoH2PerformanceModel"`](#simple-natural-geoh2-performance): A basic natural geologic hydrogen model for calculating the wellhead gas flow over the well lifetime (`plant_life`) and the specific hydrogen flow from the accumulated gas.

- [`"StimulatedGeoH2PerformanceModel"`](#templeton-serpentinization-geoh2-performance): A stimulated geologic hydrogen model that estimates the hydrogen production from artificially stimulating geologic formations through a process called serpentinization.

There is one cost model available to model the hydrogen well subsurface, which applies to both natural and stimulated geologic hydrogen.

- [`"GeoH2SubsurfaceCostModel"`](#mathur-modified-geoh2-cost): A subsurface cost model that calculates the capital and operating for subsurface well systems in geologic hydrogen production.

### Simple Natural GeoH2 Performance

The modeling approach in this performance model is informed by:
- Mathur et al. (Stanford): <https://doi.org/10.31223/X5599G>
- Gelman et al. (USGS): <https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1900>
- Tang et al. (Southwest Petroleum University): <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petsci.2024.07.029>

The natural geologic hydrogen model is able to model well decline over time and there are two methods of decline.
1. If not specified or `use_arps_decline_curve` is `False`: the decline rate will be linear over the lifetime of the well as defined in the attribute `plant_config["plant"]["plant_life"]`
2. If `use_arps_decline_curve` is `True`: The well production will decline according to the Arps model as defined in Tang et al. (Southwest Petroleum University): <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petsci.2024.07.029>. There are several options for using the decline curve to model well production.
    1. `decline_fit_params` is a dictionary where a user can specify the decline rate and loss rate. It should be noted that typically the modeling of these decline rates are monthly. This model uses hourly timesteps so the decline and loss rate should be modified accordingly.
    2. `decline_fit_params["fit_name"]` is an optional string that can be specified within the `decline_fit_params` dictionary that will model a decline rate similar to those noted at either the "Bakken", "Eagle Ford" or "Permian" shale wells documented in Tang et al. (Southwest Petroleum University) Figure 7: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petsci.2024.07.029>.

## Hydrogen Surface Processing Models

There is one performance model and one cost model available to model the hydrogen surface processing, and only for natural geologic hydrogen. There are currently no surface processing models implemented for stimulated geologic hydrogen.

- [`"AspenGeoH2SurfacePerformanceModel"`](#aspen-geoh2-surface-performance): A series of empirical relations between wellhead flow/concentration and processing plant performance, based on the [ASPEN](https://www.aspentech.com/en/products/engineering/aspen-plus) process models.
