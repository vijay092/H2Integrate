# Bulk Hydrogen Storage Cost Model

## Storage Types

H2Integrate models at least three types of bulk hydrogen storage technologies:

- **Underground Pipe Storage**: Hydrogen stored in underground pipeline networks
- **Lined Rock Caverns (LRC)**: Hydrogen stored in rock caverns with engineered linings
- **Salt Caverns**: Hydrogen stored in solution-mined salt caverns

These storage options provide different cost-capacity relationships suitable for various scales of hydrogen production and distribution.

## Cost Correlations

The bulk hydrogen storage costs are modeled as functions of storage capacity using exponential correlations:

$$Cost = \exp(a(\ln(m))^2 - b\ln(m) + c)$$

where $m$ is the useable amount of H₂ stored in tonnes.

## Installed Capital Cost and Lifetime Storage Cost

The figures below show how storage costs scale with capacity for different storage technologies:
