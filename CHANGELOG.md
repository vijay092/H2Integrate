### Updates
#### Modeling
- Change commodity in DRI and EAF model from pig iron to sponge iron based on likely carbon content [PR 670](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/670)
- Added electricity and water consumption profiles as outputs to the `ECOElectrolyzerPerformanceModel` [PR 690](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/690)
- Add per-year pricing support for Grid and Feedstock cost models, allowing price arrays of length `plant_life` in addition to scalar and per-timestep arrays. [PR 700](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/700)
- Added ability to have a custom/user-specified resource model [PR 698](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/698)
- Add `{commodity}_set_point` as an input to hydrogen fuel cell model [PR 709](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/709)
- Rename `n_control_window` to `n_control_window_hours` for unit clarity [PR 712](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/712)
- Creates a series of preprocessing tools for basic state name and abbreviation handling, and for reverse geocoding coordinates to state data. [PR 719](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/719)
- Creates a series of preprocessing tools for downloading EIA natural gas prices to monthly and hourly timeseries that could be extended to other EIA API data in the future. [PR 719](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/719)
- Added ability to use timeseries for finance calculations [PR 725](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/725)
- Added multivariable purge gas stream output to `AmmoniaSynLoopPerformanceModel` [PR 760](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/760)
- Add `constant` pricing mode for Grid cost models, allowing an explicit scalar price configuration alongside `per_timestep` and `per_year` modes. [PR 764](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/764)
- Added dynamic operating constraints (turndown, ramping, warm/cold start delays) to `AmmoniaSynLoopPerformanceModel` and split `AmmoniaSynLoopCostModel` into its own module. [PR 770](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/770)
- Added an optional `inflation_rate` input to `NumpyFinancialNPVFinanceConfig` that is combined with `real_discount_rate` via the Fisher equation to form the effective rate passed to `numpy_financial.npv`, allowing users to supply either a nominal discount rate (with `inflation_rate=0`, the default) or a real discount rate together with an explicit inflation rate. Matches how ProFAST combines its real discount rate and `general_inflation` inputs. [PR 788](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/788)
- Renamed the `discount_rate` input to `real_discount_rate` in `NumpyFinancialNPVFinanceConfig` to clarify that it is combined with `inflation_rate` via the Fisher equation. The ProFAST models keep their existing `discount_rate` name. Updated the numpy NPV model, tests, docs, and the example 19 config accordingly. [PR 788](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/788)
- Connect each cost-aware system-level controller's `{tech}_buy_price` input directly to the technology's own buy-price input via OpenMDAO 3.44 input-to-input connections, so a single `prob.set_val()` on (for example) `grid.electricity_buy_price` now propagates to the SLC. [PR 791](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/791)
- Added system-level-controller unit tests that confirm the `cost_per_tech: feedstock` mode correctly sums `VarOpEx` from all upstream feedstocks for a multi-feedstock dispatchable, including a fuel-cell-style hydrogen-plus-oxygen scenario and a case with feedstocks at different graph depths. [PR 793](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/793)
- Updated ammonia synloop test values and loosened test value tolerances due to unnecessary sensitivities from dynamic behavior [PR 795](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/795)
- Removed hard-coded logic of price units in finance models to be flexible to any type of commodity. Created helper functions `_compute_price_units` and `_compute_rate_units` in `h2integrate.finances.tools` and integrated usage of these functions into all finance models  (`numpy_financial_npv`, `profast_npv`, `profast_lco`) accordingly. [PR 786](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/786)
- Added capability to specify demand technology for system-level control, and renamed the framework-derived system-level control classification dict from `slc_config` to `slc_topology` to distinguish it from the user-authored `control_parameters` block. [PR 784](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/784)
- Updated `commodity_sell_price` input to `ProFastNPV` to be per year of the plant life. Also updated `BasicProFASTParameterConfig.as_dict()` so explicitly input escalation values are not overwritten to the general inflation rate [PR 799](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/799)
- Added `calc_azimuth_angle()` to `PYSAMSolarPlantPerformanceModel` to provide default azimuth angle based on whether the site is in the northern or southern hemisphere [PR 806](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/806)
- Renamed `OpenLoopStorageControlBase` to `OpenLoopControlBase` and `OpenLoopStorageControlBaseConfig` to `OpenLoopControlBaseConfig` and moved them out of the control storage sub-directory. [PR 828](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/828)


#### Infrastructure
- Grouped closely related test assertions into behavior-focused subtests and documented when to use subtests in the developer coding guidelines. [PR 839](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/839)
- Renamed `{commodity}_demand` inputs to `{commodity}_set_point` on all converter performance components to align with storage baseclass naming and distinguish converter operating targets from demand components. [PR 691](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/691)
- Minor cleanup to `pose_optimization` [PR 695](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/695)
- `feedstocks.py` has moved from `h2integrate/core/` to `h2_integrate/feedstocks` [PR 719](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/719)
- Added basic check of 4-length connections in `technology_interconnections` [PR 720](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/720)
- Adds `H2IntegrateModel`, `load_yaml`, `write_yaml`, and `write_readable_yaml` as package-level imports [PR 728](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/728).
- Reduced import time for `h2integrate_model.py` by deferring imports of heavy dependencies until they are needed [PR 762](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/762)
- Renamed `design_of_experiments` to `parameter_sweep` throughout the codebase to avoid confusion with "Department of Energy" (DOE) in the energy domain. The core code supports both the new `parameter_sweep` and legacy `design_of_experiments` YAML keys for backward compatibility. Updated all driver configs, examples, tests, and documentation. Added generator type descriptions to the parameter sweep docs page and updated the run-cases docs to recommend parameter sweeps over manual for-loops. [PR 768](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/768)
- Added imports for individual models to the appropriate `__init__.py` files to allow for direct imports of models from the package level and to ensure all models are properly imported and used in `supported_models.py` [PR 769](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/769)
- Speed up the slowest tests in the suite by swapping the Floris wind model for `PYSAMWindPlantPerformanceModel` in examples 01 (`01_onshore_steel_mn`) and 02 (`02_texas_ammonia`), updating the affected `test_steel_example`/`test_simple_ammonia_example` expected values, fixing a pre-existing `cases.sql` cache-path bug and module-scoping the fixtures in `h2integrate/postprocess/test/test_sql_timeseries_to_csv.py` so the example only runs once for all four tests. [PR 782](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/782)
- Exposed `n_timesteps`, `dt`, `plant_life`, and `fraction_of_year_simulated` as attributes on `CostModelBaseClass` (matching `PerformanceModelBaseClass`) and updated all cost and performance model subclasses across `h2integrate/` to use these attributes instead of reading them from `plant_config`, removing redundant boilerplate from individual components. [PR 783](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/783)
- Rewrote the "Adding a new technology" developer guide. Also replaced the hand-maintained model overview page with an auto-generated section (`docs/generate_model_overview.py`) that classifies every registered class in `supported_models` and appends the first sentence of each class's docstring. Migrated `.readthedocs.yaml` to invoke `docs/build_book.sh` via `build.commands` so hosted and local builds stay in sync. [PR 787](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/787)
- Moves `h2integrate/resource/utilities/file_tools.py::check_resource_dir` to a general function `h2integrate/core/utilities/file_utils.py::check_data_dir` with a wrapped version for resource data (`check_resource_dir`) and feedstock data (`check_feedstock_data`). [PR 791](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/791)
- Removed the `is_electricity_producer` helper from `h2integrate.core.commodity_stream_definitions` and the electricity-specific auto-detection branch in `H2IntegrateModel`, making finance-subgroup `commodity_stream` resolution fully commodity-agnostic; updated example `plant_config.yaml` files that previously relied on the auto-detection to set `commodity_stream` explicitly. [PR 786](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/786)
- Ensure OpenMDAO data is cleaned up during testing [PR 797](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/797).
- Reduced Sphinx documentation build warnings from roughly 880 to under 20. [PR 800](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/800)
  - Set `napoleon_use_ivar` and added `napoleon_custom_sections` so custom Google-style sections (Inputs, Outputs, Promoted Inputs, Promoted Outputs, Subsystems, Discrete Inputs, Discrete Outputs, Options, Behavior, Side Effects) render cleanly.
  - Suppressed the `etoc.toctree` category emitted by autosummary `:recursive:` stubs.
  - Cleared stale `_autosummary/` files at the start of every docs build.
  - Removed duplicated `Methods:` docstring sections that collided with autodoc method discovery.
  - Added `:no-index:` to hand-authored autoclass directives that duplicated autosummary entries.
  - Cleaned up docstring formatting bugs across roughly twenty source files (bullet and definition list separations, starred attribute markers, unbalanced backticks, and stray substitution references).
  - Fixed several MyST cross-reference targets (missing labels, ambiguous doc vs ref targets, incorrect autosummary path, duplicate labels, broken image path, and a broken literalinclude path).
  - Added a custom `docs/_templates/autosummary/module.rst` template that filters pytest `conftest.py` submodules from generated stubs, eliminating the "failed to import conftest" warnings that appeared on the Read the Docs build.
  - Renamed the `GeoH2SubsurfaceCostModel` MyST label in `docs/technology_models/geologic_hydrogen.md` to `mathur-modified-geoh2-cost` to remove an ambiguous cross-reference with the autosummary entry for the Python class of the same name.
- Updates `h2integrate/core/file_utils.py::check_data_dir` to allow for the creation of nested directories, not just the final subdirectory for smoother initialization of a feedstock directory [PR 801](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/801).
- Adds `feedstock_dir` to the EIA natural gas retrieval to align the downloading or loading of the feedstock data with the resource data methodology [PR 801](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/801).
- Add support for slice notation in technology connections to allow users to connect between variables of different shapes. [PR 774](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/774)
- Updated edge attribute `commodity` of in `H2Integrate.create_technology_graph` to use lists instead of strings to account for systems with multiple commodities connected between two technologies [PR 823](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/H2Integrate/pull/823)
