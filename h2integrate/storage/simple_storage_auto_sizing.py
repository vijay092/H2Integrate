        Part 1: calculate the storage sizes (charge rate, discharge rate, and capacity)
        needed to meet the demand. The steps to do this are:

        1) Calculate the max charge and discharge rate as the maximum of the `commodity_in`
            profile and oversize to account for charge/discharge efficiencies.
        2) Estimate the storage SOC (in `commodity_amount_units`). The SOC increases when
            charging and decreases when discharging. If `commodity_set_point` is input,
            calculate the storage SOC as the cumulative summation of the negative of
            `commodity_set_point` input (`commodity_set_point` input is
            negative when charging and positive when discharging).
            Otherwise, calculate the storage SOC as the cumulative summation of
            `commodity_in - demand`.
        3) If needed, adjust the SOC profile from Step 2 so that the minimum SOC is positive
        4) Calculate the usable storage capacity as the difference between the
            maximum SOC and minimum SOC from Steps 2 and 3.

        1) Estimate the starting SOC (as a fraction) at the start of the simulation.
            Take the first value in the SOC profile (in `commodity_amount_units`)
            and divide by the storage capacity
