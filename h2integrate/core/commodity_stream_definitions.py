Commodity stream definitions for H2Integrate.

1. multivariable_streams: Definitions for streams that bundle multiple related variables
2. add_multivariable_output / add_multivariable_input: Helpers to register all
   constituent variables of a multivariable stream on an OpenMDAO component
3. is_electricity_producer: Helper function to identify electricity-producing technologies
